Much of this coordination has gone unnamed because consensus remains sovereign and informality has functioned as a kind of protective ambiguity. The term “commons” describes that existing reality. The Bitcoin Commons is a project built to observe, document, and make sense of those coordination dynamics without claiming authority, enforcement power, or consensus control. Naming a commons is not neutral. It can reduce confusion and make hidden tradeoffs legible, but it can also concentrate soft power, create targets for leverage, and accelerate failure modes that look less like resource depletion and more like coordination erosion. Skepticism toward naming is therefore rational, not reactionary. The unresolved question is whether an unnamed commons can continue to scale as Bitcoin becomes infrastructure, and whether recognition strengthens resilience or quietly undermines it. Answering that requires theory, not instinct."})})]})})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=5997)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
